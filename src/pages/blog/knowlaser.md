DID YOU KNOW?

**LASER**

The word laser is an acronym or abbreviation for **l**ight **a**mplification by **s**timulated **e**mission of **r**adiation.

A laser beam is a single wavelength light, coherent or focused and therefore can travel over vast distances. Laser is created when the gases in a chamber are excited into a non-equilibrium condition, thus when a photon of light is introduced into the excited mix of gases a coherent radiation is produced.

Lasers may operate in a continuous wave mode or in a pulsed mode. In the latter situation, the energy that results is stored or halted and suddenly released in a controlled sequence.

When laser beams are focused onto tiny spots, they can be put to vast array of applications or uses - medical, printing, communication, military, ***cutting and engraving***, and so forth.
