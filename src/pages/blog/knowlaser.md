DID YOU KNOW?

**LASER**

The word laser is an acronym or abbreviation for **l**ight **a**mplification by **s**timulated **e**mission of **r**adiation.

A laser beam is a single wavelength light, coherent or focused and therefore can travel over vast distances. Laser is created when the gases in a chamber are excited into a non-equilibrium condition, thus when a photon of light is introduced into the excited mix of gases a coherent radiation is produced.

Lasers may operate in a continous wave mode or in a pulsed mode. In the latter situation, the energy that results is stored or halted and suddenly released in controlled sequence.

When laser beams are focused onto tiny spots, they can be put to vast array of applications or uses - medical, printing, communication, military, ***cutting and engraving***, and so forth.
